# Sentiment Analysis with MLflow Tracking

This repository contains a pipeline for sentiment analysis using MLflow for experiment tracking. The pipeline performs data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, with all key metrics and artifacts logged to MLflow for easy tracking and reproducibility.

## Project Overview

This project uses a logistic regression model to perform sentiment analysis on the Sentiment140 dataset. MLflow is used to:
- Track parameters, metrics, and model artifacts.
- Manage multiple experiment runs for hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.
- Log model artifacts with detailed metadata for later use and deployment.

### Key Features
- **Data preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes text data, removing stop words.
- **Feature extraction**: Uses TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.
- **Model tracking with MLflow**: Logs hyperparameters, evaluation metrics, model artifacts, and metadata.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Kaggle API** to download the dataset
- **MLflow**, **pandas**, **numpy**, **nltk**, **scikit-learn**, and **kagglehub**

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up MLflow

1. **Start the MLflow Tracking Server**:
   To use MLflow’s UI locally, run:
   ```bash
   mlflow ui
   ```
   By default, this will open the MLflow UI at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. **Download the Dataset**:
   Ensure the Kaggle API is set up on your system and download the Sentiment140 dataset with `kagglehub`.

### Running the Pipeline

1. **Run the main pipeline**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This will execute the end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline and log results to MLflow.

2. **Experiment Tracking**:
   After running the pipeline, open the MLflow UI (from Step 1 in Setting Up MLflow) and navigate to the experiment to view:
   - **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.
   - **Parameters**: Hyperparameters such as regularization strength.
   - **Model Artifacts**: Logistic Regression model artifacts.

## Code Structure

- **`main.py`**: Contains the main pipeline and MLflow tracking code.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions for data loading and text preprocessing.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all required packages for the project.

## Example Usage

1. **Start the Experiment**: Set the experiment name in the code (`mlflow.set_experiment("Sentiment Analysis Experiment")`) and configure model hyperparameters as needed.
2. **Train the Model**: Run the `main.py` script to process data, train the model, and log metrics to MLflow.
3. **Track Results in MLflow**:
   - View metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Analyze logged models and download artifacts directly from the MLflow UI.

## Viewing Results

- Launch the MLflow UI with:
  ```bash
  mlflow ui
  ```
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
- Navigate to your experiment (default: "Sentiment Analysis Experiment") to view detailed experiment tracking.
